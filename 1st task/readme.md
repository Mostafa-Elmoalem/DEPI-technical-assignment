## 📌 Overview
This is a minimalist personal portfolio website built entirely using **Pure Semantic HTML5**. 

The goal of this project was **not** to build a visually styled website (no CSS was used), but to master the core fundamentals of web structure:
- **Semantic Hierarchy:** Understanding when to use `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and `<aside>`.
- **Accessibility (a11y):** Ensuring the site is navigable via screen readers.
- **SEO Optimization:** Implementing correct meta tags, canonicals, and heading structures (`h1`-`h6`).
